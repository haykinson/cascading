/**
 * An Aggregator takes the set of all values associated with a unique grouping and returns
 * zero or more values. {@link cascading.operation.aggregator.Max}, {@link cascading.operation.aggregator.Min},
 * {@link cascading.operation.aggregator.Count}, and {@link cascading.operation.aggregator.Average} are good examples.
 * <p/>
 * Aggregator implementations should be reentrant. There is no guarantee an Aggregator instance will be executed in a
 * unique vm, or by a single thread. The {@link #start(cascading.flow.FlowProcess, AggregatorCall)}
 * method provides a mechanism for maintaining a 'context' object to hold intermedite values.
 * <p/>
 * Note {@link TupleEntry} instances are reused internally so should not be stored. Instead use the TupleEntry or Tuple
 * copy constructors to make safe copies.
 * <p/>
 * Since Aggregators can be chained, and Cascading pipelines all operation results, any Aggregators
 * coming ahead of the current Aggregator must return a value before the {@link #complete(cascading.flow.FlowProcess, AggregatorCall)}
 * method on this Aggregator is called. Subsequently, if any previous Aggregators return more than one Tuple result,
 * this complete() method will be called for each Tuple emitted.
 * <p/>
 * Thus it is a best practice to implement a {@link Buffer} when emitting more than one, or zero Tuple results.
